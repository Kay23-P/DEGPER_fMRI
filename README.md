Motion-defined form fMRI study (Amblyopia vs Controls)

This research is being conducted in tandem with behavioural work aimed at 
(1) determining the effect of specific stimulus parameters on the typical maturation of motion-defined form perception
(2) determining the effect of specific stimulus parameters on global motion and motion-defined form perception in children with amblyopia
